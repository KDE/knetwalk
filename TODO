1. review game logic
    - make the game end when all cpu's are connected, not also cables (change docu accordingly)
    - change scoring system (show moves, starting from -xx and time, and score (less is more))
    - make boards wider than high, if it doesn't cause problems
1a. rewrite graphic scene code
    - use QGraphicsScene/View
    - caching
    - themable
    
2. add shortcuts
3. support for changing themes (KHotNewStuff ???)
4. use pop-up notification used in other games (for instance kmines)
5. whatsthis isn't show easily add an help icon or questionmark or something... (in the game field maybe..)
6. initial window size depending one the screen size (possible with kde? also usefull in other games!)
7. show the solution

BUGS:
    sometimes it seems to go in infinite loop when starting a new game... check it!!
