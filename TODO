BUGS:
=====

* sometimes it seems to go in infinite loop when starting a new game... check it!! 
  (maybe it's fixed: didn't happen for a long time)
* when a new game starts there are unneeded repaints


TODO:
=====

== short term ==
* check if forground and background cache makes sense in cell.cpp
* if it isn't to hard use a menu to change the theme
* show the solution
* fix globals.h, include.h, etc. (use one unified header for that stuff)
* better default size

== medium term ==
* fix highscores (lot of problems)
* allow games with different aspect ratios
* allow customized game (perhaps giving it a custom name)
* make the difficulty change less when playing the same difficulty level

== long term ==
* change Directions (not sure)
* profiling
* look if it's possibly to optionally use openGl (to have smooth rotations)
* whatsthis isn't show easily add an help icon or questionmark or something... (in the game field maybe..)
* initial window size depending one the screen size (possible with kde? also usefull in other games!)
* next move hint
* demo mode


KDEGAMES: (things that might apply to the whole kdegames)
=========

* add a handbook button to the toolbar
